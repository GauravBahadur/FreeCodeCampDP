# FreeCodeCampDP

## I've tried to replicate the code written by Alvin, in the FreeCodeCamp Dynamic Programming tutorial, in JavaScript to Java. 

I've used the same variables names as by Alvin, I've tried to comment/explain why I did what I did to overcome language restrictions or lack of my understanding of Java. S
At some places I had to copy code from StackOverflow to perform a certain thing.

If you find any issues or want some improvement please let me know. Thanks!
